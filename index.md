_Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances._

_For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline._

_Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me._
